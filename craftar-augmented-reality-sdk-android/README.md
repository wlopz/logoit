## Catchoom CraftAR - Android SDK

Catchoom allows to create recognition only and Augmented Reality (AR)
experiences using the Catchoom CraftAR Service and its Mobile SDK ('Mobile SDK').

With Catchoom, you can create amazing apps that provide digital content
for real-life objects like printed media, packaging among others. You
can use our online web panel or APIs, to upload images to be recognized and set
AR content to display upon recognition in your Catchoom-powered
app.
